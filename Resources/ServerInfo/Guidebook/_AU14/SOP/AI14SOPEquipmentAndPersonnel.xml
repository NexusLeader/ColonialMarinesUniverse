  # Equipment and Personnel Standards

  These are sets of regulations and policies that govern the use of equipment and standards of appearance for military personnel.

  ## Standard Issue Equipment
  - Standard issue equipment is defined as any military or police uniform, armor, weapon, or accessory personnel find in their vendors, as well as anything they awake with or anything normally available from requisitions or respective armory(s).
  - The Acting Commander may issue special equipment on a case by case basis, such as special headsets or special weaponry for certain personnel or units as long as it does not violate the UCMJ.
  - Alcohol must be stored in the officer's mess or an officer's office(s).

  ## Uniform Regulations
  Personnel are required to be wearing appropriate clothing during operations. SOP may not be changed to allow personnel to deploy without clothes or uniform.
  - Deploying personnel must be wearing their uniform, boots and chest protective armor at minimum. Suit webbings may be used in the place of chest protective armor.
  - All positions required to wear armor at all times may temporarily remove it while on a friendly ship and/or installation or after an operation has ended for social events, such as memorials. Other forms of clothing like service jackets may be used during this time.
  - All personnel must wear their uniform and assigned footwear, or a standard issue replacement.
  - Auxiliary staff and support crew should not be in armor unless the ship/base is on a security alert, or are deploying to the AO.
  - MP/Law Enforcement, combat personnel and flight crew are permitted to wear armor on the ship/installation, as part of their job.
  - Any headwear that is worn must be standard issue, or an acceptable replacement. Exceptions must be made for reasonable religious headdress
  - Anyone of higher rank may still order any personnel below them to wear a protective helmet or vest unless they are a rifleman who has not been issued a special weapon.
  - Folding or otherwise shortening uniforms is permitted, provided no damage comes to the uniform.

  ## Firearm Handling Regulations
  - Weapons should be holstered or slung when not in use and on safety. Personnel must be allowed to holster or sling on their first offense.
  - Under normal circumstances, weapons may only be fired in the firing range.
  - Training equipment like training grenades and training ammunition must only be used in firing ranges.
  - Weapons may not be left unattended unless properly secured in spaces intended for them, like weapon racks or cabinets.

  ## Grooming Standards
  - Personnel must maintain a professional and operationally safe hairstyle while on duty.
  - Hair may be worn down to the shoulders in a bob or similar style, but must be tied back if it extends any longer.
  - Tied-back hair, such as ponytails, may extend to the small of the back but must not exceed that length or wrap around to the front.
  - Facial hair is permitted but must not extend below the neckline or past the face in any direction.
  - Hair must be of a natural color.

  [italic]OOC Note: Character appearance is a significant part of roleplay and can greatly impact a player's experience. For this reason, if you choose to enforce grooming standards, you must allow the player to either adjust their own hairstyle or choose a new one for themselves. [/italic]
