  # Rules of Engagement

  Authority is determined by rank. The highest ranking individual present is the acting authority and holds final decision making power, unless command is explicitly delegated by an individual of higher rank.

  If two individuals of equal rank are present, authority defaults to the individual with greater seniority (time served).
