  # Command Regulations

  ## Conduct of Briefing
  The Acting Commander is responsible for ensuring a proper briefing is conducted before any operation begins and personnel are deployed.
  - It must be performed in an area where a proper inspection of personnel can be held and where personnel can hear any orders.
  - Areas that interfere with non-combat personnel must be avoided, for example the medbay.
  - Briefings at minimum must include all deploying faction command (SLs, JOs, etc).

  ## Command Field Deployment
  The Command Staff has the right to deploy to the frontline for the sake of commanding their personnel from a direct point of view. Deployments must be for the sake of the personnel and operation, and not for the personal glory of the Command Staff. At least one member of Command Staff must remain on the ship/installation to man the CIC.

  When Deployed:
  - The deploying Command Staff must still command and communicate frequently with their faction.
  - Combat should be reserved when assisting personnel in a supporting capacity, in defense of others and self, or directly leading an offensive maneuver.
  - They should avoid unnecessarily putting themselves in danger and remain close to personnel to focus on providing clear orders.
