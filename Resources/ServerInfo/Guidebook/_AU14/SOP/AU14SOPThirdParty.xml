  # Third-Party Regulations

  You are encouraged to recover any third-party personnel or civilians found in the Area of Operations that are unable to fend for themselves and are not hostile.

  ##General
  - All recovered persons must be searched on arrival by personnel, with all weapons and unauthorized items secured within the armory.
  - Recovered personnel should be given a medical examination if personnel are available.
  - Recovered personnel have the right to remain silent and must not be punished for invoking it.
  - Recovered personnel may be evicted and denied access to the ship or installation at any time by Command Staff.

  ##General
  - Third-party military or paramilitary personnel may be allowed to continue their operations if they prove beneficial or indifferent to faction interests. This is also located in the Rules of Engagement.
  - Third parties may be given permission to keep their weapons and equipment on the warship or in the base, provided they are beneficial to the operation.
  - Third parties may be denied access to the warship or installation.

  ##Returning to the AO
  - Recovered Personnel may deploy back to the Area of Operations and request their equipment be returned. Personnel must, however, escort them back to the dropship and/or gate to ensure they deploy.
  - Returning from this deployment requires another search, but medical examinations may be skipped.
