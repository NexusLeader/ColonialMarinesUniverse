  #ROLEPLAY RULES
  These rules apply in character and are enforced universally.

  ##Act like an actual character in this setting.
  - Do not use text speak or emoticons in character, and do not refer to out of character things like admins or rounds in-game. Do not break character at anytime except when using LOOC/OOC.
  - Do not reference memes in character.
  - Do not use emotes or LOOC/OOC to bypass speech filters/accents or muteness.
  - You are not required to write a backstory; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role and a believable character.
  - Some actions have no delay to make gameplay like reloading smoother. Do not abuse this to spam any kind of sounds.
  - Exercise reasonable self preservation. Don't intentionally hurt or kill your character (or other players characters) without good reasoning.
  - A (mostly) sane, well-rounded character would not engage in actions that are overly painful, or put themselves in harm's way, without consideration. Exceptions are made for characters in cultist or other overtly insane roles. 

  ##Use Realistic Character Names
  Use a reasonable, unique, lore-friendly character name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name.
  - No names or references of people or characters from the real world, alien franchise and/or other forms of media.
  - Names should not be written in all Caps Lock
  - No titles/ranks/honorifics. Titles, ranks and honorifics include but are not limited to; Dr/Doctor, Jr/Junior, Major.
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names.
  - Up to three characters of Roman numerals may be used in the place of a nickname.

  ###Nicknames
  - Nicknames may be used in the format of, in single quotes, Firstname 'Nickname' Lastname.
  - Nicknames can be at most two words.
  - Up to three characters of Roman numerals may be used in the place of a nickname.

  ###Exceptions
  - Artificial Womb (AW) Soldier characters may have "AW" in the place of a nickname. As an AW Soldier you must have a weapon produced pre-2010 as your last name.
  - Synthetic characters may use a single first name as their character name. Synthetic characters may choose to use a normal name alternatively.
  - A name comprised of extremely common names (I.E John Williams) can be excused for being shared with someone famous, provided the player is not attempting to imitate or overtly reference the linked person.

  ##Character Memory
  Your personal character may remember events that occurred in previous rounds and discuss them, but may not mention or remember their own death or the death of another present character.

  CMU is a "first contact" server. Your character does not retain any knowledge or memories of encountering specific non-human or covert threats/third parties from previous rounds. All rounds involving the threats/third parties listed below should be treated as first contact (your character has no idea they exist) unless explicitly stated otherwise by your role or staff.
  - Death Squads
  - Black Goo (Zombies)
  - Xenomorphs (including xeno cultists)
  - Engineers
  - Praetomorphs
  - Fulfremmen
  - Yautja

  ##Respawning
  If you die and respawn, you may not return as a character you previously played in the same round. For example, if you played "John Doe," you should not respawn as "John Doe."

  You may use the same character appearance and respawn under a different name, as long as you roleplay as a separate individual and do not use their previous memories for an advantage. 

  ##Suicides
  - You must have a valid roleplay reason to commit suicide. Your character must truly have no other way out or be faced with a circumstance worse than death (torture, capture by xenos, etc).
  - Starting and then cancelling a suicide will be treated the same as an actual suicide unless accidental and also requires a valid reason.

  ##High Roleplay Roles
  Some roles greatly affect the round and require a higher level of roleplay prowess and, as such, have their own rules. [textlink="Click here to read about these roles." link="AU14HighRoleplayRoles"]

  ##Military Roles
  A person with a "military role" is defined as any character apart of GOVFOR and/or OPFOR or currently apart of a uniformed force of an established nation (UA, TWE, CCA, UPP, etc). CLF and other insurgents are not considered to be a military role, even if backed by a nation.

  ###Players in military roles must abide by the following:
  - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces except in extreme circumstances where it is the only way to preserve your life (surrender, etc).
  - All characters in military roles are mentally stable and fit for duty. Some leeway may be provided when it comes to being minorly mentally unstable, however it must not effect your ability to function in your role.
  - All military roles should be following their role objectives and the orders of those above them, except where it would lead to imminent loss of life through obvious negligence or incompetence.
  - Support roles (medical, engineering, non-combat synths, military police, etc) should primarily focus on providing support and engage in combat only in self-defense or to protect nearby fellow faction members.
  - Military roles may not violate the UCMJ or SOP where it would be unrealistic (committing egregious offenses in front of an officer/military police, disrupting briefings, assaulting faction members with little to no reason, killing civilians without purpose, etc).

  ##Timeline and Lore
  You are not expected to know every bit of Aliens lore and will not be moderated for it, you are however expected to exercise reasonable judgment with your roleplay.

  The internet as we know it never developed in the Alien setting, so do not use modern internet slang and culture in-character.

  Except where otherwise specified, CMU canon is determined by the following:

  CMU Lore > CM13 Lore > ALIEN The Roleplaying Game > The Films.
