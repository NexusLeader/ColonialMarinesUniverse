  - Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, sexism, ableism, or any other form of real world discrimination. This includes using letter substitutions to disguise offensive language or as a "joke".

  - Genitalia should never be given explicit description.
  - Distasteful but non-sexual bravado do not apply to this so long as it is not directed towards another player.

  - Players knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned. Appeal with the account you intend to use.

We do allow discussing bans in our discord for transparency reasons so long as it remains a civil discussion.
